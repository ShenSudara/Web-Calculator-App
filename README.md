<h1> Web Calculator App </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Web Calculator App has been designed and developed for learning, practicing, and enhancing knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The Web Calculator App has been specially designed and developed to calculate and solve maths problems fast and efficiently. While the application will accept the user input as a string and separate it into operands and operators, avoiding unnecessary inputs and misplacing parameters of a math expression.</p>
<p>The web calculator app provides an opportunity to experiment with coding techniques and gain beginner experience in developing functional and visually appealing web projects.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  <h3>Real-time Expression Calculation</h3>
  <p>With the power of real-time expression calculation as the app dynamically evaluates mathematical expressions after you complete them. No need to press calculate or an equal(=) button answer is there.</p>
 </li>
  <li>
   <h3>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo</h3>
   <p>These operations can be done, using this application.</p>
 </li>
   <li>
   <h3>User Input Validation</h3>
   <p>javaScript functionalities will ensure that only valid numeric characters and operators are typed and accepted. Irrelevant data can't be input.  This not only prevents errors but also promotes good coding practices. 
   </p>
   <p>This application will accept the expression format of 
     &emsp;&emsp; 
    <h2><i>[Operand1] [operator] [Operand2]</i></h2>
For example, if the user wants to perform a calculation, it must be input in this format. 
   </p> 
    <ol type="1">
     <li>If a user mistakenly inputs two operators, the application will identify it and avoid that.</li>
     <li>Users can't mistakenly type operators first, the application is identified and avoided. </li>
     <li>After the operands, the user can't input the calculation operators again. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>All the input validation is handled by using the javascript</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h3>Ready for next calculation</h3>
  <p>After performing calculations every time application is ready to process the next expression.</p>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p>This application has mainly been developed by using HTML, CSS, and javascript. I've added some comments, to explain the code in every stage and you can study from those.</p>

<p>The basic structure of the application is,</p>
<ul>
 <li>First, take the user input as a string. </li>
 <li>Then validate and remove unnecessary data on those expressions. While the validation process, even the user can't input unnecessary data.</li>
 <li>Separate Operators and Operands</li>
 <li>After, Show the Result. </li>
 <li>When entering another input, previous answers and expressions will be clear and ready to perform it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Languages Used to Development</h4>
<uL>
 <li>HTML</li>
 <li>CSS</li>
 <li>Javascript</li>
</uL>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>After cloning the repository to your device, Just click the index.html file to run on your device. *The browser Javascript should enable to run* </p>
